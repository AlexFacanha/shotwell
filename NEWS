Shotwell 0.2.0 - 7 August 2009
------------------------------

  * Color histogram now available in adjustment tool.
  * Drag-and-drop now supports the modifier keys for linking and asking
    which operation to perform.
  * Shotwell no longer uses a hardcoded directory for storing imported
    photos.
  * A nasty bug causing the X server to crash under compiz was fixed.
    (#380)
  * Support for libgee-0.3.0.


Shotwell 0.1.2 - 3 August 2009
------------------------------

  * Red-eye reduction feature now available.
  * File/Import From Folder offers one more way to import photos into the
    library.
  * Color adjustment (exposure/saturation/tint/temperature) now available.
  * Support for Vala 0.7.5.


Shotwell 0.1.1 - 30 June 2009
-----------------------------

  * Bug fix: Dragging a selection band to the bottom of the window to start
    scrolling results in compiz crashing.  This fixes that problem, although
    another reported problem still exists (#380).
  * Changed package dependency from vala-1.0 to gee-1.0.  Although Vala is
    required to build Shotwell, it does not need to be installed to execute
    it.  Gee provides the collections library Shotwell requires.
  * Fixed code to compile with Vala 0.7.4.
