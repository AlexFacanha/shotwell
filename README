    Shotwell Photo Organizer
    ------------------------
    
  * Introduction
    
    Shotwell is a digital photo organizer designed for the GNOME desktop
    environment.  It allows you to import photos from disk or camera,
    organize them in various ways, view them in full-window or fullscreen
    mode, and export them to share with others.
    
    As this is an early release, not all features normally associated with
    photo organizers are implemented.  Visit http://www.yorba.org/shotwell for
    the current state of its development and to make sure you're running the 
    latest version.
    

  * Installation & Licensing
    
    Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.
    

  * Quick Start
    
    When you first run Shotwell, you'll be presented with an empty window and
    two views: Photos and Events.  Your first task will be to begin populating
    your photo library.
    
    There are two ways to import photos: via drag-and-drop and from a digital
    camera.
    
    * Drag-and-drop: Simply drag photos from your file manager and drop them
    onto the Shotwell window.  You may drag files or directories.  The photos
    will be imported into the library.
    
    * Camera: Connect your digital camera to your computer.  Shotwell will 
    detect it and list it in the sidebar.  When you select the camera, Shotwell 
    will load previews of each photo.  You may choose specific photos to 
    import or to import them all.
    
    Shotwell uses gphoto to communicate with digital cameras.  If your camera 
    does not appear in Shotwell's sidebar or there is a problem importing
    photos, visit http://www.gphoto.org to see if it is supported.
    
    Once your photos are in Shotwell's library, you can view, edit, and export
    them.  More features are planned, so check http://www.yorba.org/shotwell
    regularly for updates.
