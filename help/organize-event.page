	<title>Events</title>

    <p>An event is a group of photos that were taken at approximately the same time.
    When you import photos, Shotwell looks for the exposure date within the photos left by your camera.
    Shotwell then clusters the photos into events.
    </p>

    <section>
    <title>Key Photos</title>

    <p>If you select the Events item in the sidebar, you'll see a single photo which represents each event.
    This is called the key photo.
    Double-clicking on the key photo will take you to the collection of photos in that event.</p>

    <p>By default, Shotwell uses the first photo in each event as its key photo.
    To use a different key photo, select it and choose <guiseq><gui>Photos</gui><gui>Make Key Photo for Event</gui></guiseq>.</p>

    <title>Renaming events</title>

    <p>To give an event a name rather than refer to it by its date, choose <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Rename Event...</gui></guiseq> and enter a new name.</p>

    <section>
    <title>Moving Photos</title>

    <p>Even though events are always stored by their date, you can move photos between events, which can affect their sort order.
    To move photos between events, drag any imported photos to the sidebar and drop them on an event name.</p>
