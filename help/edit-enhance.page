	<title>Enhancing</title>

    <p>Clicking on the <gui>Enhance</gui> button is a quick way to automatically adjust the brightness of your photo. It will often give you a photo that is correctly exposed. You can also use it as a starting point and then improve the adjustments by clicking on the <gui>Adjust</gui> button</p>
    <p>It will adjust the brightness range, setting the white point and black point so that the brightness varies from a small amount of pure black in your photo to a small amount of pure white in your photos.</p>
