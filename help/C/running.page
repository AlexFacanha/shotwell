	<title>Running Shotwell</title>

<p>Once installed, Shotwell is available in your <gui>Applications</gui> menu under <gui>Graphics</gui> or <gui>Photography</gui>. Shotwell may also be executed automatically when a camera is plugged in to your computer. Check your <gui>Preferred Applications</gui> settings to enable Shotwell to run when a camera is detected.</p>

<p>Shotwell may also be executed directly from its build directory, although this is only recommended for testing out Shotwell or for developers.</p>
