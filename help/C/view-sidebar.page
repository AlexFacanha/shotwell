	<title>The Sidebar</title>

<p>The sidebar on the left side of the Shotwell window lists various views of your library. Each view is known as a collection. Although you may see the same photo in multiple collections, it's only stored once on your hard drive.</p>

<p>The Photos collection displays all the photos in your library.</p>

<p>The Events collection lists all events in your library.  An event is a group of photos that were taken at approximately the same time.</p>

<p>The Tags folder in the sidebar lists all tags you've assigned to photos.  Photos can have multiple tags attached to them, and when you click on the name of a tag in the sidebar, you will see all the photos associated with that tag.</p>
