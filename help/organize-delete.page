    <p>You may remove photos from your library and you may additionally delete them entirely from your hard disk.</p>

<p>This diagram shows how the photo, when deleted, first is put into Shotwell trash, and then, if deleted from Shotwell trash, is put into your computer's trash. If you delete it from your computer's trash the photo is finally and irretrievably deleted from your storage medium.</p>
